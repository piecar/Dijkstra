# Dijkstra
A Java implementation of Dijkstra's

INPUT:
The first line contains TT, denoting the number of test cases. 
First line of each test case has two integers NN, denoting the number of nodes in the graph and MM, denoting the number of edges in the graph.

The next MM lines each consist of three space-separated integers xx yy rr, where xx and yy denote the two nodes between which the undirected edge exists, rr denotes the length of edge between these corresponding nodes.

The last line has an integer SS, denoting the starting position.
